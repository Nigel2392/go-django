# Signals

**Note**: This documentation page was (in part) generated by ChatGPT and has been fully reviewed by [Nigel2392](github.com/Nigel2392).

The Pages app uses a signaling system to notify listeners about lifecycle events in the page tree. This allows for custom behaviors on actions such as creation, update, deletion, or movement of page nodes.

## Key Signal Types

- **BaseSignal**  
  Contains a reference to the `Querier` (for database operations) and a `context.Context`.

- **PageNodeSignal**  
  Extends `BaseSignal` and provides the affected `PageNode` and a corresponding page ID.

- **PageSignal**  
  Contains a reference to a generic Page object.

- **PageMovedSignal**  
  Provides information about a node move operation, including the node itself and both the new and old parent nodes.

## Predefined Signals

- **SignalRootCreated**  
  Emitted when a new root page is created.

- **SignalChildCreated**  
  Emitted when a child page is added.

- **SignalNodeUpdated**  
  Emitted after a page node is updated.

- **SignalNodeBeforeDelete**  
  Emitted before a node is deleted.

- **SignalNodeMoved**  
  Emitted after a node is moved.

## Example

Listening to a signal is straightforward. Here's an example of listening to the `SignalChildCreated` signal:

```go
pages.SignalChildCreated.Listen(func(s signals.Signal[*pages.PageNodeSignal], pns *pages.PageNodeSignal) error {
    // Custom logic to handle the signal.
    return nil
})
```

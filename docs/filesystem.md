# Filesystem

The filesystem is a tree of directories and files.

To easily work with files within the framework and provide a uniform approach to handling files and directories, the framework provides a filesystem abstraction.

All filesystems ultimately do adhere to the `fs.FS` interface from the `io/fs` package.
